This is a popular quote. I’d like to modify this by:

So, I’m keeping this consumption log, where I log media that I consume. Think of it as a deliberate history tab that I maintain. If my browser history is positive and forward looking then I’m **growing** and forward looking as well.

1. I listened to this podcast on my morning walk today:
	It was the 278th episode of the Jesse Chappus show. It featured Robin Sharma, the author of "*The 5AM Club*" . 
	I really enjoyed listening to Robin's view on waking up before the sun rises, the journey that one goes through in the 66 days of habit formation and the transformational power of the "mother habit" or so he calls it.
	Listen to it [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1EOmNM421XXKH9Ns1msK7y?si=0ce091e5e54445fb)

2. What? There’s a [school in Singapore that gives you 100k to build a startup on an Island](https://ns.com)? (https://ns.com/)

3. Found this startup by an 18 year old called [https://starcy.ai/](https://starcy.ai/). It feels like it's a [Poke](https://poke.com/) clone except created by Indian founders. Really exciting.

	1. Set aside time
	2. “I need your help” (puts both of you on the same team)
	    1. I need your help to know how to feel about X
	    2. I need your help to understand if you’ve ever been in such a position
	    3. I need your help to know how think about this situation I’m in
	3. End with “I feel X about our conversation”
	    1. I feel more settled post our conversation
	    2. I feel calmer and more happy post our conversation
