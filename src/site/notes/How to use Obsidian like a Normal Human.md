First of all, do not watch any YouTube video that's longer than 10 minutes.
Second of all, if you see someone using a really really elaborate system, run away from it as fast as you can.
Third of all, don't create more complexity than necessary.
Fourth of all, find a friend who uses Obsidian too and have regular chats with them about how to optimise your Obsidian Vault and how to links notes together.

Also read the Reddit ObsidianMD discord for interesting threads etc about Obsidian!
