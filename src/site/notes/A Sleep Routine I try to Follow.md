All of my friends have bad and unhealthy sleep cycles. I too have a bad, irregular and erratic sleep schedule. Successful people have good sleep schedules.
## **Ground Rules**

1. [Don’t drink any caffeine post 2pm](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/) i.e. have all the caffeine you want in the morning, but nothing post 2pm in the afternoon.
2. Naps: allowed before 3 pm, `20` minutes max.
3. Phone charges outside reach of the bed.

## What I'm doing to fix it:

So here’s what I’m planning to do (post conversations with GPT and reading books) to improve my sleep schedule:

1. I end the day with 3 bullet points for tasks I have to do the next day. I bought this really nice pad that really enables one to do that. (cap it @ 2mins max; don’t overthink it)

2. I change into my “night dress”. Now there’s no actual need to do this, but this sends a clear signal to your brain that the work day is over and you cannot do anymore work.
    
3. I sit down and Journal about my day on a pen and paper book that I keep on top of the pillow on my table. I write about the things I accomplished that day. I write about random fun things in it as well and I also write about my feelings. This really helps me to unload all the words, thoughts and worries from my brain onto paper and makes my problems real, quantifiable and fixable. Bed = sleep only.
    
4. Then I do a 10 or 2 min mediation from the Medito App - a body checkup
    
5. Then by then, I’m sufficiently relaxed to drift off to sleep.
